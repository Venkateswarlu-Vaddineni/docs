This is Introduction to Linux Operating System

ðŸ’» What is Linux?

Linux is a free & open-source operating system (OS) based on Unix. It powers everything from smartphones (like Android) and personal computers to servers, supercomputers, and even IoT devices.

Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux gives users more control over the system and is highly customizable. Itâ€™s known for being stable, secure, and efficient â€” making it popular among developers, system administrators, and tech enthusiasts.

ðŸ§± Key Components:

Kernel: The core of the OS that interacts with hardware.

Shell: Interface to interact with the kernel via commands.

File System: Hierarchical structure where everything is a file (even devices!).

Distributions (Distros): Flavors of Linux like Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch, etc.

```bash
ls -l #Lists the files in current working directory in list view

ls -a #Lists all files in current working directory including hidden files

ls -al /home/ #Lists all files in /home Directory in list view including hidden files
```

```bash
pwd         #Prints present working directory on terminal

date        #Prints today's date on terminal

mkdir venkat       #Creates a Directory name venkat in current working directory
```
