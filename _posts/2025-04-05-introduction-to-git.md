## üß† Git Basics ‚Äì Just What You Must Know
<button onclick="printPost()" class="print-btn">üñ®Ô∏è Print This Post</button>
Let‚Äôs walk through Git using a simple real-world scenario:
> Imagine you're writing a small program and want to track your changes efficiently, experiment safely, and roll back when needed. Git helps you do all of that, locally, without any remote server.

---

## üìå What is Git?

Git is a **free and open-source distributed version control system**, created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005 to manage the Linux kernel codebase.

### Why It Matters
- It tracks changes to your codebase over time.
- It helps teams collaborate efficiently without overwriting each other's work.
- Every developer has a **complete local copy** of the entire project history.

### Key Concepts
- **Snapshots, not differences**: Git saves a snapshot of the entire project at each commit.
- **Branching and merging**: Work on multiple features or bug fixes in isolation.
- **Local-first**: Make all changes locally and push when you're ready to share.

#### üß™ Practice:
- Try using a text editor to make a small change in a file and manually save versions with different names.
- Now imagine Git doing that automatically, but much smarter and more efficient.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è First-Time Git Setup

Before using Git, you need to configure your personal information and preferred editor (VS Code in this example):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
git config --list
```

- `user.name` and `user.email` will be attached to every commit you make.
- `core.editor` sets VS Code as your default Git editor.
- `git config --list` confirms your global settings.

#### üß™ Practice:
- Run the config commands and check with `git config --list`.
- Try changing your name and verify the update.

---

## üîß Basic Git Commands

### üìÅ Initialize a Repository

Start tracking a folder with Git:

```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
git init
```

This creates a hidden `.git` folder ‚Äî Git's database for tracking your project. You can now begin version controlling this folder.

#### üß™ Practice:
- Create a test folder on your machine and initialize it with `git init`.
- Use `ls -a` to view the hidden `.git` folder.

### Clone an Existing Repo

Instead of starting from scratch, clone a remote repository:

```bash
git clone https://example.com/your-repo.git
```

This downloads the project, initializes Git, and sets the remote origin.

#### üß™ Practice:
- Try cloning any public GitHub repo, like `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git`.

More Examples:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:user/repo.git           # Using SSH
git clone --depth=1 <url>                        # Shallow clone (faster)
git clone --branch dev <url>                     # Clone specific branch
```

---

### ‚ûï Stage & Commit Changes

One of the key steps in using Git is saving your work in stages. First, you "stage" the files ‚Äî this tells Git which changes you want to include in the next snapshot (commit). Then you "commit" those staged changes, creating a permanent record in your project‚Äôs history.

Think of it like this:
- You‚Äôre editing a document (working directory).
- You select what you want to save (staging area).
- Then you save it (commit) to your project history.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

- `git add .` stages all modified and new files.
- `git commit` records the current snapshot of staged changes.

More Useful Variants:
```bash
git add file.txt                      # Add a single file
git add *.js                          # Add all JS files
git commit -am "Quick update"         # Stage & commit tracked files
git commit --amend                   # Modify the last commit
git reset HEAD file.txt              # Unstage a file
git add -p                           # Interactively stage changes
```

### When to Use Them:
- Use `git add file.txt` to add a specific file instead of everything.
- Use `git commit -am` for a quick save if you're working with tracked files.
- Use `git add -p` when you only want to commit *part* of your changes in a file ‚Äî great for splitting up work.

#### üß™ Practice:
- Create a `hello.txt` file, write something, and use `git add` and `git commit` to save it.
- Edit the file again, then use `git add -p` to stage only a portion of your changes.
- Try `git commit --amend` to edit the last commit message or add forgotten files. changes and record them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

- `git add .` stages all modified and new files.
- `git commit` records the current snapshot of staged changes.

Other Useful Variants:
```bash
git add file.txt                      # Add a single file
git add *.js                          # Add all JS files
git commit -am "Quick update"         # Stage & commit tracked files
git commit --amend                   # Modify the last commit
git reset HEAD file.txt              # Unstage a file
git add -p                           # Interactively stage changes
```

#### üß™ Practice:
- Create a `hello.txt` file, write something, and use `git add` and `git commit` to save it.
- Run `git log` to see your commit.

---

### üîç Monitor Your Work

Check status and view your commit history:

```bash
git status
git log
```

- `git status`: Shows what‚Äôs staged, unstaged, or untracked.
- `git log`: Shows commit history with author, date, and message.

More Examples:
```bash
git log --oneline                    # Condensed history
git log --graph --decorate           # Show branches, tags, merge lines
git diff                            # See unstaged changes
git diff --cached                   # See staged but uncommitted changes
git show <commit>                   # Show details of a specific commit
git log --author="Your Name"        # Filter commits by author
```

#### üß™ Practice:
- Modify a tracked file and use `git status` to see the change.
- Use `git log` after several commits and note the difference between full and one-line views.

---

### üîÄ Branching

#### Why Use Branches?
Imagine working on a new feature like "dark mode" while your main branch is stable. Branches let you experiment safely.

```bash
git branch                          # List branches
git checkout -b dark-mode           # Create and switch
```

Or with the modern command:

```bash
git switch -c dark-mode
```

Switch back to `main` with:

```bash
git switch main
```

More Commands:
```bash
git branch -d dark-mode             # Delete a branch
git branch -m old-name new-name     # Rename a branch
git switch -                       # Switch to last used branch
git branch --merged                # See branches already merged
git branch --no-merged             # See branches not yet merged
```

#### üß™ Practice:
- Create a branch called `feature-test`, switch to it, and make a commit.
- Switch back to `main` and confirm your changes aren‚Äôt visible there.

---

### ‚áÇ Merging Changes

After testing in a branch, merge it into the main codebase:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge dark-mode
```

Git will try to automatically merge changes. If there are conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them manually.

More Examples:
```bash
git merge --no-ff feature           # Preserve branch history
git merge --squash feature          # Combine all branch commits into one
git merge --abort                   # Cancel a conflicted merge
```

#### üß™ Practice:
- Edit the same file on both `main` and your feature branch. Merge to observe a conflict.
- Use a code editor or `git status` to resolve the conflict and finish the merge.

---

### ‚è∫ Undo / Revert

Undoing in Git has layers. Here's how to handle different situations.

#### Discard Local Changes (Unstaged)
```bash
git restore file.txt
```
Reverts `file.txt` to the last committed version.

#### Unstage a File
```bash
git restore --staged file.txt
```
Removes `file.txt` from staging, but keeps your working copy.

#### Soft Reset (Keep Changes Staged)
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
Moves back one commit, but keeps your changes staged.

#### Mixed Reset (Unstage Changes)
```bash
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
```
Moves back one commit, keeps changes but unstaged.

#### Hard Reset (Remove Everything)
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
Moves back one commit and discards all local changes.

#### Revert a Commit
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```
Creates a new commit that undoes the effect of a previous one.

More Useful Examples:
```bash
git checkout -- file.txt             # Legacy way to discard local changes
git clean -fd                        # Remove untracked files & folders
git reflog                           # Recover lost commits
```

#### üß™ Practice:
- Commit a dummy file. Try `--soft` and `--hard` resets. Observe staged vs. removed content.
- Use `git revert` on an earlier commit and note the new reversal commit.

---

### ‚è≤ Navigate to Previous Commits

Sometimes you need to explore or revert to an earlier state of your project ‚Äî for debugging, testing, or recovering lost progress. Git allows you to move through the history of commits with ease.

To **view or test older versions** of your project without affecting current progress, use:
```bash
git checkout abc1234
```
- This puts you in **detached HEAD mode**, meaning you're viewing an old snapshot of your code.
- You can explore, run, and even make changes (though these changes won‚Äôt be saved to a branch unless explicitly committed to one).

To **return to your working branch**, simply run:
```bash
git switch main
```

To **rewind your current branch** to a previous state:
```bash
git reset --hard abc1234
```
- This resets the branch to a specific commit and deletes all changes after that commit.

More Examples:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~2          # Go back 2 commits
```
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1      # Go back one commit but keep changes staged
```
```bash
git reset --mixed HEAD~3     # Go back 3 commits and keep changes in working directory
```
```bash
git reflog                   # View history of HEAD, useful to recover lost work
```

#### üß™ Practice:
- Use `git log --oneline` to list recent commits.
- Pick one hash and run `git checkout <hash>` to view that version.
- Try switching back using `git switch main`.
- Experiment with `git reset` variants and note how each behaves with your files and staging.

You can go back in time to explore or test past versions:

```bash
git checkout abc1234
```

- Detached HEAD mode allows inspection without altering history.

Return to latest:
```bash
git switch main
```

Reset back to a specific commit:
```bash
git reset --hard abc1234
```

More Examples:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~2       # Go back 2 commits
git log --oneline         # View commit hashes
git reflog                # See HEAD history for recovery
```

#### üß™ Practice:
- Use `git log` to find an earlier commit and checkout that commit.
- Return to your latest commit with `git switch main`.

---

## üß© Real-World Use Cases

- **New Feature**: Branch off, build, test, and merge.
- **Oops Moment**: Use `git reset`, `restore`, or `revert` to undo.
- **Explore Past**: Use `git log`, `checkout`, and `reflog` to navigate.
- **Track Progress**: `git status`, `diff`, and `log` keep you informed.
