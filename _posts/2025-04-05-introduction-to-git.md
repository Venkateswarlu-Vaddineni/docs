## üß† Git Basics ‚Äì Just What You Must Know

<button onclick="printPost()" class="print-btn">üñ®Ô∏è Print This Post</button>

Let's walk through Git using a simple real-world scenario:
> Imagine you're writing a small program and want to track your changes efficiently, experiment safely, and roll back when needed. Git helps you do all of that, locally, without any remote server.

### üìå What is Git?
Git is a **free and open-source distributed version control system**, created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005 to manage the Linux kernel codebase.
It lets you track changes, collaborate efficiently, and experiment without fear of breaking things.
- **Distributed Version Control System**
- Tracks **changes in code** and enables **collaboration**
- Every developer gets a **full local repo** with history

## ‚öôÔ∏è First-Time Git Setup
Before using Git, configure your identity and preferred editor (VS Code in our case):

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
git config --list
```

This sets your name, email, and editor globally (applies to all repos). The last command confirms the setup.

## üîß Basic Git Commands

### üìÅ Initialize a Repo
To start a Git repository:
1. First, **create a folder** (or use an existing one) and move into it.
2. Then initialize the Git repository:

```
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
git init
```

This sets up the folder as a Git repository by creating a hidden `.git` directory inside it.

Alternatively, if you're working with a remote project, you may **clone** an existing repo which initializes it automatically:

```
git clone https://example.com/your-repo.git
```

This downloads the project and sets it up with Git tracking immediately.

### ‚ûï Stage & Commit
Once your code is ready, you need to save a snapshot of it in Git.

```
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

- `git add .` stages all new and modified files.
- `git commit` permanently saves the staged snapshot with a message.

### üîç Status & Log
Monitor the state of your files and view history.

```
git status
git log
```

- `git status` shows tracked, modified, and untracked files.
- `git log` shows all commits, with author, timestamp, and message.

### üîÄ Branching

#### Why Branches?
Imagine you're developing a new feature, fixing a bug, or testing something experimental. You don‚Äôt want to mess up your main codebase, so you create a separate line of development called a **branch**. This way, you can work in isolation and merge it back only when it‚Äôs ready.

**Real-World Example**: 
You're building an app. The main branch has the working version. You want to add a "dark mode" feature without affecting the current app. So you create a branch `dark-mode`, build and test there, and merge it when done.

```
git branch
git checkout -b feature-x
git switch main
```

- `git branch` lists all branches.
- `git checkout -b` creates and switches to a new branch.
- `git switch` is the modern way to switch branches.

### ‚áÇ Merge Changes
After finishing work in another branch, bring changes into your main branch.

```
git merge feature-x
```

This merges the `feature-x` branch into your current branch.

### ‚è∫ Undo / Revert
Fix mistakes and undo recent work carefully.

```
git restore file.txt
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

#### `git restore file.txt`
Use when you made changes to a file but want to discard those changes and return the file to its last committed version.

**Real-World Example**: You changed a config setting and it broke the app. Use restore to undo the changes and go back to the last working version.

#### `git reset --soft HEAD~1`
Moves the HEAD pointer back by one commit but keeps all your changes in the staging area.

**Real-World Example**: You committed with a typo or forgot to include a file. Use this to fix your commit without redoing the work.

#### `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
Moves the HEAD back by one commit and completely removes any changes made ‚Äî both in staging and working directory.

**Real-World Example**: Your last commit is entirely wrong and you want to erase it and its changes completely.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:**
- Once you use `--hard`, the removed commits are lost unless recovered via `git reflog`.
- You can‚Äôt move forward again unless you've noted the commit hash before reset.

### ‚è≤ Navigate to Previous Commits
You can move back to earlier commits using `HEAD~n`, where `n` is how many commits to go back.

```
git reset --hard HEAD~3
```

Alternatively, you can use the commit hash:

```
git reset --hard abc1234
```

To find commit hashes, use `git log`. You only need the first few unique characters.

To explore a past commit without changing the project history:

```
git checkout abc1234
```

This puts you in a detached HEAD state ‚Äî great for viewing or testing past versions.

**Note**: After a hard reset, if you didn‚Äôt note the commit hash, recovery is difficult.
